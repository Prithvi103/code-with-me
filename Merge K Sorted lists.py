Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

Example:

Input:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

"""
The idea is to maintain a heap which has all the heads of the different lists. The count variable is used in case if there is a tie between multiple heads.
